    - Manually adjusted several bonfires along my tests and adjustments from reports. Thanks guys!
    
    - Added better quest detection, in case a quest related to an event is turned in, but the quest isn't part of the database, or is not located in the appropriate location, it will be printed in the chat so you can easily copy paste it to me so I can update the location.
    - I think the calendar changes requires a specific API call to force the calendar to update, currently deployed two fixes that should improve the event detection greatly.

    - Added patterns to match quest titles for various locales associated with the various world events. If a quest is turned in that matches a pattern but isn't part of the module, i.e. the quest is new or not tracked, the same report as inaccurate location will be printed in the chat for the user to copy and paste back to us to add the missing location.
